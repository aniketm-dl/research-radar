  # Darpan Labs business context for relevance filtering
  business_context: |
    Darpan Labs builds AI-powered digital twins of consumers for market research and customer understanding.

    Our core technology:
    - Creating synthetic personas/users that mimic real consumer behavior
    - Using LLM agents to simulate customer decision-making and preferences
    - Enabling companies to test products, messaging, and strategies with AI consumer twins
    - Providing behavioral insights without needing large-scale human surveys

    We focus on:
    - Consumer behavior modeling and prediction
    - Synthetic data generation for market research
    - LLM-based agents for understanding customer preferences
    - Survey augmentation and preference elicitation
    - Behavioral science applications in marketing
    - Agent-based modeling of consumer decision-making

    We are NOT interested in:
    - Manufacturing or industrial applications
    - IoT devices and smart infrastructure
    - Supply chain or logistics optimization
    - Physical system modeling (buildings, vehicles, etc.)
    - Healthcare digital twins (unless behavioral/consumer focused)

  # Research focus for LLM query generation
  research_focus: |
    Digital twins and synthetic users for consumer and customer research.
    Focus on:
    - Behavioral modeling of consumers using AI/LLM agents
    - Synthetic personas and virtual consumers for market research
    - LLM-based agents for understanding customer preferences and behavior
    - Agent-based modeling for consumer decision making
    - Survey augmentation and preference prediction using language models
    - Applications in marketing, consumer research, and behavioral science

    NOT interested in:
    - Manufacturing digital twins
    - Industrial IoT applications
    - Physical infrastructure twins
    - Supply chain optimization
    - Smart cities or transportation

  # Topics to explicitly exclude from searches
  exclude_topics:
    - manufacturing
    - industrial IoT
    - smart cities
    - supply chain
    - infrastructure monitoring
    - predictive maintenance

  # Fallback queries (used if LLM generation is disabled or fails)
  fallback_queries:
    - '"digital twin" AND (consumer OR customer) AND (behavior OR preference) NOT (manufacturing OR IoT OR industrial)'
    - '"synthetic users" AND "language model" AND (marketing OR consumer OR survey)'
    - '("synthetic persona" OR "virtual consumer") AND (simulation OR modeling)'
    - '"LLM agent" AND (consumer OR customer) AND (research OR study OR survey)'
    - '"agent based" AND (consumer OR customer) AND (simulation OR modeling) NOT (supply chain)'
    - '"preference prediction" AND ("language model" OR LLM) AND consumer'
    - '"survey augmentation" OR ("retrodiction" AND consumer)'
